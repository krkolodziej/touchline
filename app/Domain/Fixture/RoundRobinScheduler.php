/**
 * The circle method: every club meets every other exactly once.
 *
 * No Eloquent, no models, no container — ids in, pairings out. That is not tidiness for its
 * own sake. A scheduling bug is the kind that shows up as "round 14 looks wrong" weeks
 * later, and the only way to be confident is to test the algorithm exhaustively: every pair
 * meets once, nobody plays twice in a round, the byes land where they should. That test
 * file has to be instant, and it is only instant if nothing here touches a database.
 *
 * How it works, in case the modular arithmetic is not self-evident: one club is pinned and
 * the rest rotate around it. With `n` clubs there are `n - 1` rounds, and in each round the
 * pinned club plays whoever has rotated into the first slot while the remaining clubs pair
 * off inwards from the ends.
 *
 * An odd number of clubs is handled by adding a placeholder nobody can play; the club drawn
 * against it simply has no fixture that round. The rounds still number `n`, because every
 * club needs its week off.
