/**
 * A position, in the two letters a squad list has room for.
 *
 * The same principle as `MatchStatusBadge`: the abbreviation carries the meaning and the tone
 * is decoration, so the badge reads correctly in greyscale and to anyone who cannot separate
 * the colours. That is also why none of these is yellow or red — the design system reserves
 * both for cards, and a defender is not a booking.
