/**
 * The badge's whole design rests on one claim: the abbreviation carries the meaning and the
 * colour is decoration. That is what makes it readable in greyscale and to anyone who cannot
 * separate the four tones — and it is exactly the kind of rule a later refactor quietly drops
 * when someone decides a coloured dot looks tidier.
 *
 * So the assertions are about text, never about classes. A test that pinned the Tailwind
 * classes would break on every restyle while proving nothing about what a reader can tell.
