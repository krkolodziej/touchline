/**
 * Five statuses, five *structurally* different treatments — not five colours.
 *
 * Colour alone excludes anyone who cannot distinguish it, and it competes with the two
 * colours this application has reserved for cards. So live gets a pulsing dot, full time is
 * solid, cancelled is struck through, and postponed carries a rule down its left edge. Each
 * reads correctly in greyscale.
 *
 * The pulse is the only self-animating thing in the app, which is what makes it mean
 * something. `motion-reduce` turns it off for anyone who has asked for that.
